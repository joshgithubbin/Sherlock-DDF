See the [wiki](https://github.com/joshgithubbin/Sherlock-DDF/wiki) for catalogue information and code user guides.

_Sherlock_ is a software package and integrated massive database system that provides a rapid and reliable spatial cross-match service for any astrophysical variable or transient. The concept originated in the PhD thesis of D. Young at QUB, and has been developed by Young et al. in many iterations and cycles since. It associates the position of a transient with all major astronomical catalogues and assigns a basic classification to the transient. At its most basic, it separates stars, AGN and supernova-like transients. It has been tested within QUB on a daily basis with ATLAS and Pan-STARRS transients, and within PESSTO as part of the PESSTO marshall system that allows prioritising of targets. It is thus a boosted decision tree algorithm. A full paper describing the code, catalogues and algorithms is in preparation (Young et al. in prep). A summary is included in Section 4.2 of “Design and Operation of the ATLAS Transient Science Server” ([Smith, Smartt, Young et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09052)).

[The Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://rubinobservatory.org/about) is a brand new astronomical facility on top of Cerro Pachón, a mountain in Northern Chile. Rubin Observatory will conduct a 10-year survey of the Southern Hemisphere sky (referred to as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or [LSST](https://rubinobservatory.org/explore/lsst)) with the goal of answering some of astronomers' biggest questions about the Universe.

Every night for a decade, Rubin Observatory will take images of the sky using a 3200 megapixel camera and six different optical filters. Each image covers an area as big as 40 full moons, and the giant 8.4-meter telescope can move between different positions in less than five seconds. In this way, the telescope will image the entire visible sky every 3-4 nights. This makes Rubin Observatory particularly good at detecting objects that have changed in brightness, like supernovae, or in position, like asteroids. Additionally, Rubin Observatory’s light-collecting power and sensitive camera will help us discover ~17 billion stars and ~20 billion galaxies we’ve never seen before.

In addition to the main wide-fast-deep survey (roughly 18,000 deg2), 10-20% of observing time will be dedicated to other programs, including mini-surveys and intensive observation of a set of Deep Drilling Fields. Deeper coverage and more frequent temporal sampling (in at least some of the ugrizy filters) will be obtained for the Deep Drilling Fields than for typical points on the sky. The full Deep Drilling Field program will address a broad range of science topics, including Solar System, Galactic, and extragalactic studies.
